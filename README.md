# Data Analysis and Visualization Project: Exploring Relationships Between Neighborhoods, Districts, Zip Codes etc. and Home Prices in New York City
Description:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the relationships between various factors such as neighborhoods, districts, zip codes, and the year built, and how they relate to home prices in New York City. While an artificial intelligence model was utilized to predict home prices, it's important to note that due to limitations in the quality of available data and the lack of significant correlations among variables, the model's performance might not meet the desired expectations. Nevertheless, the primary emphasis of this project lies in the exploration, analysis, and visualization of the relationships among the provided data points.

Key Objectives:

Data Exploration: The project aims to thoroughly explore the dataset containing information about neighborhoods, districts, zip codes, and the year built of homes in New York City. This includes identifying trends, patterns, and potential correlations among these factors.

Visualization: Utilizing various data visualization techniques, the project intends to visually represent the relationships discovered during the data exploration phase. This could involve creating scatter plots, heatmaps, bar charts, and other visualizations to better understand how different variables interact with each other.

Correlation Analysis: Despite the challenges posed by limited data quality and weaker correlations, the project seeks to identify any meaningful relationships that could still exist between the provided variables. Statistical methods and correlation coefficients might be employed to quantify the strength and direction of these relationships.

AI Model Implementation: While acknowledging the limitations of the AI model's predictions due to the quality of data, the project will include the implementation details of how the model was trained and utilized to predict home prices based on the available variables.

Insights and Discussion: The project will conclude with a discussion of the insights gained from the data exploration, visualization, and correlation analysis. Any notable trends, patterns, or relationships that were uncovered will be highlighted, even if they are not strong enough to support accurate predictions.

In summary, this project aims to showcase the process of exploring and visualizing the relationships between neighborhoods, districts, zip codes, year built, and home prices in New York City. While the AI model's performance might not be optimal due to data limitations, the primary goal is to reveal any potential insights and connections that can be gleaned from the available dataset through thorough analysis and effective visualization techniques.
